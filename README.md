# Shinobu 🐈
Converse from anywhere, anytime. Shinobu is a versatile cross-platform bridge bot.

## Why build Shinobu?
I was the lead developer behind Unifier, another open-source bridge bot. I discontinued it a while
back because of burnout and didn't really intend to build another bridge after that.

But right after discontinuing Unifier, people suddenly needed reliable bridges from Discord more
than ever due to recent events. While I didn't want to get back into working on bridges at first,
it quickly became clear to me that this was too big of an issue to keep ignoring.

But I didn't want to revive Unifier. Its codebase is a mess. Trying to re-engineer it would be
more of a hassle, and all previous attempts just further contributed to burnout. Working on it was
simply unsustainable for me, even if it would've been best in the long run once I got the rewrite
done and over with.

So I'm starting from a clean state and building a new bridge that better adapts to today's needs,
that's also flexible and ready for the demands of tomorrow.

## Todo
- [X] Shinobu Runtime (core, secrets manager, debug tools, etc)

This is just a rough list of attributions, I'll do a proper one as I work on the project.
